# Interfaces

Informations about interfaces of UNO objects are taken using the introspection and the type description manager because of the com.sun.star.lang.XTypeProvider interface does not provide complete information of the interfaces supported by the target.

If you push IDL Ref. button of the MRI window, MRI tries to open IDL Reference of the interface at the caret position of the information edit.

And listeners supported by the target are listed with supported interfaces.
